""" Classification

The objective of this task is to build a classifier that can tell us whether a new, unseen deal 
requires a coupon code or not. 

We would like to see a couple of steps:

1. You should use bad_deals.txt and good_deals.txt as training data
2. You should use test_deals.txt to test your code
3. Each time you tune your code, please commit that change so we can see your tuning over time

Also, provide comments on:
    - How general is your classifier?
    - How did you test your classifier?
