""" Features

The objective of this task is to build a classifier that can tell us whether a new, unseen deal 
requires a coupon code or not. 

We would like to see a couple of steps:

1. You should create your own sample set of deals from the deals.txt file to perform your task
2. When given the following deals, can you tell us whether it requires a coupon code or not?
    2.1 "10% off Shoes when you use code 10OFF"
    2.2 "Learn to code in Java with these great training kits"
    2.3 "Free shipping when you enter FREESHIP at the checkout"
