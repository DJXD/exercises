General Instructions
--------------------
- Your first task should be to fork this repo into your own account, where you will commit your work
- When you are happy with your solutions, submit a pull request to the parent project
- Make sure you regularly check-in your code. We look at your solutions, and your stream of consciousness. Just like on the line, we don't want to simply see a big giant hairball check-in
- If you have any problems or questions, check the parent project's issues space. If you don't find the answer there, create a new issue, and we'll respond asap
