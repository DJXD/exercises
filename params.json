{"name":"Engineering Exercises","tagline":"Various coding exercises for job interviews, etc.","body":"### Why?\r\nBuilding a team of world class engineers is a non-trivial process. One of the challenging parts of this process is the interview phase. While some teams like to adopt \"Interview 2.0\" style brain teasers, or pull coding questions from the 1967 Guide to Algorithms and Data Structures field manual, we think it's more important to collaborate together on a real-life situation, specific to the domain of work that the role requires.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a candidate's time is a premium, so we've tried to find a balance between a meaningful and engaging engineering exercise, and something which becomes onerous. \r\n\r\nThe exercises are broken up by role domain, and are constructed in such a way that they focus on the most critical aspects of the job, as opposed to scaffolding.\r\n\r\n### How?\r\nThe best process we've found is:\r\n\r\n1. Invite a candidate to fork the repo into their own account\r\n2. Encourage a candidate to regularly commit their code into their fork so you can observe their stream of consciousness\r\n3. When they're complete, they only need to submit a pull request to your repo\r\n4. You can use this pull request as the basis for conversation, then close without merging when the process is complete\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
